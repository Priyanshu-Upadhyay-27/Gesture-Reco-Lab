Hand Recognition Projects
It includes all those projects which uses Open Cv and Mediapipe for hand recognition
I had also created a module inspired from a video of youtube and used it here, and created a project called Hand Volume Control out of it.
As this is my first repository, I will try to add more projects of hand recognition created on my own.
You can run these programs using:
Pycharm : python version-3.9, IDE
Mediapipe : version - 0.10.14, Module for Hand Recognition
OpenCv : version - 4.10.0.84, Module for Computer Vision
pycaw, Module for audio toggle
